# Gemini Development Log

This file tracks the development progress of the `radartui` project, guided by the Gemini agent.

## Current Status: Core Framework Implemented

- **[2025-08-08]** Foundational data classes (`Color`, `Size`, `Offset`, `EdgeInsets`, `Axis`) are implemented, providing the basic building blocks for the UI framework.
- **[2025-08-08]** The rendering layer, including `RenderObject` and `RenderBox`, is in place, establishing the mechanism for drawing objects to the screen.
- **[2025-08-08]** A scheduler (`SchedulerBinding`) has been introduced to manage the application's lifecycle and trigger UI updates.
- **[2025-08-08]** Terminal services (`Terminal`, `KeyParser`, `Logger`, `OutputBuffer`) are available for direct interaction with the terminal, handling input, output, and logging.
- **[2025-08-08]** The widget framework, with `Widget`, `Element`, `StatelessWidget`, and `StatefulWidget`, is implemented, mirroring Flutter's declarative UI pattern.
- **[2025-08-08]** The `runApp` function is available, providing the entry point for running a `radartui` application.
- **[2025-08-08]** Basic widget set (`basic.dart`) is available.

## Next Steps

1.  **Expand Widget Library**: Create a richer set of widgets, such as `Row`, `Column`, `Text`, `Container`, and more, to enable the creation of more complex UIs.
2.  **Implement Layout Engine**: Develop a robust layout engine within the rendering layer to handle the positioning and sizing of widgets.
3.  **Enhance Terminal Services**: Improve the terminal services to support more advanced features, such as mouse input, and to provide more control over terminal colors and styles.
4.  **Develop a Theming System**: Create a theming system to allow for easy customization of the look and feel of applications.
5.  **Write Comprehensive Documentation**: Write detailed documentation for all public APIs, including examples of how to use them.
6.  **Create More Examples**: Develop a wider range of example applications to showcase the capabilities of the framework.
