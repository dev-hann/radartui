# Gemini Development Log

This file tracks the development progress of the `radartui` project, guided by the Gemini agent.

## Current Status: Initial Setup

- **[2025-08-06]** Project structure initialized from scratch.
- **[2025-08-06]** Core directories (`lib/src`, `example`, `test`) have been created.
- **[2025-08-06]** Basic configuration files (`pubspec.yaml`, `.gitignore`, `analysis_options.yaml`, `README.md`) are in place.

## Next Steps

1.  **Scaffold Project Structure**: Create the complete directory and file structure with class and method stubs, detailing their purpose with comments. This will serve as a blueprint for development.
2.  **Implement Foundation Layer**: Build the fundamental data classes like `Color`, `Size`, `Offset`, etc.
3.  **Implement Services Layer**: Develop the low-level terminal interaction services.
