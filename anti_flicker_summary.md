# Anti-Flickering Solution for RadarTUI

## Problem
The initial aggressive screen clearing solution caused visible flickering during every rerender.

## Final Solution Implemented

### 1. Balanced Clearing Strategy
- **`smartClear()`**: Clears only the grid buffer, preserves previous grid for diff-based rendering
- **`clearAll()`**: Complete screen clearing with terminal.clear() + grid reset
- **Strategic application**: Navigation always clears completely, regular frames use smart clearing

### 2. Frame-Type Based Clearing
- **Regular frames** (`handleFrame()`): Use `smartClear()` for flicker-free updates
- **Navigation frames** (`_handleFrameWithNavigation()`): Always use `clearAll()` for clean transitions
- **Differential rendering**: Existing flush() method provides efficient cell-by-cell updates

### 3. Optimized User Experience
- **No flickering** during animations, typing, and regular UI updates
- **Guaranteed clean navigation** - every page change starts with a fresh screen
- **Minimal performance impact** - aggressive clearing only when actually navigating
- **Double buffering** maintained for smooth differential rendering

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
- `lib/src/services/output_buffer.dart`: Added smart clearing methods
- `lib/src/scheduler/binding.dart`: Separate handling for navigation vs regular frames
- `lib/src/widgets/navigation.dart`: All navigation methods trigger navigation frame handler

### Final Clearing Strategy:
1. **Regular Updates**: `smartClear()` - no terminal flashing, smooth experience
2. **Navigation**: `clearAll()` - guaranteed clean screen, complete terminal reset
3. **Differential Rendering**: Preserved for maximum efficiency

### Key Benefits:
- ✅ **Zero flickering** during normal UI interactions
- ✅ **Clean navigation** - previous page content never persists
- ✅ **Best of both worlds** - smooth updates + clean transitions
- ✅ **Performance optimized** - aggressive clearing only when needed

This solution provides the clean navigation experience you requested while eliminating flickering during regular frame updates.
