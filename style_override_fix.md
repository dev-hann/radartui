# Text Style Override Fix for RadarTUI

## Problem Identified
When text widgets were rerendered with different styles, the previous styles weren't being properly reset, causing style artifacts and incorrect text appearance.

## Root Causes Found

1. **Incomplete Style Clearing**: The `clear()` and `smartClear()` methods weren't explicitly setting `null` style, leaving old style references in place.

2. **Inadequate ANSI Reset**: The ANSI escape code generation wasn't starting with a complete reset, causing style accumulation.

3. **Style State Persistence**: The previous grid retained style information that interfered with clean style transitions.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Cell Clearing (`/lib/src/services/output_buffer.dart:57-86`)
```dart
// Before: Cell(' ')  
// After: Cell(' ', null)
```
- All clearing methods now explicitly set `null` style
- Ensures clean slate for new style application

### 2. Improved ANSI Escape Code Generation (`/lib/src/services/output_buffer.dart:115-138`)
```dart
// Always start with reset to ensure clean style application
List<String> codes = ['0'];  // Start with reset
```
- Every style application now begins with `\x1b[0m` reset
- Prevents style accumulation and bleed-through
- Ensures proper style isolation between elements

### 3. Enhanced Flush Logic (`/lib/src/services/output_buffer.dart:140-162`)
- Improved style change detection
- Proper style resets at frame boundaries
- Clean terminal state maintenance

### 4. Grid State Management
- Both current and previous grids now use explicit `null` styles when cleared
- Forces proper style comparison and updating
- Eliminates style persistence artifacts

## Key Benefits

✅ **Clean Style Transitions**: Text style changes now render correctly  
✅ **No Style Bleed**: Previous styles don't affect new content  
✅ **Proper ANSI Handling**: Complete reset before every style application  
✅ **Consistent Rendering**: Predictable style behavior across rerenders  

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `lib/src/services/output_buffer.dart`: Enhanced clearing and ANSI generation

### Style Clearing Strategy:
1. **Explicit null styles**: All clearing operations set `Cell(' ', null)`
2. **ANSI reset prefix**: Every style starts with `\x1b[0;...m`
3. **Clean state management**: Proper previous grid cleanup
4. **Frame-end reset**: Terminal style reset at end of each flush

This fix ensures that text widget rerenders with different styles will display correctly without artifacts from previous renders.
